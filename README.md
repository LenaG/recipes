# Recipes

I've been wanting a recipe scaling utility for a while, so finally just quickly
threw one together in front of @lenag

It's very rough right now, but we have to start somewhere.

# TODO

- [ ] "compound" fractions ( "1 1/2", etc ) currently not handled properly
- [ ] ingredients without measurement not handled properly
- [ ] sub-recipe (two or more parts) not currently handled
